                which helps me out when I need some helping out. He is a Song Write/Artist as well as a very respected
                Desginer. As well as the creater of Navy's Own Records. He is good with all the adobe products from
                video editing to graphics design to photo design. He is a skilled indivudual and I am grateful to have
                him as a friend. He is a great friend as well as a great brother, he has a good heart and always does
                whats is the best simple chill solution. Not that it will benifit him but that wouldn't harm anyone in
                the long run. He is a hard worker but also can be a little bit of a procratiner but once working on a
                project, the quality will surprise you.

            <h2>Current Goal</h2>
            <p>So for the moment, we are both working on trying to get his music out there. Aubrei Prince finally
                realeased his album called BitterSweet. Now this album contains two singles call ColdHeart and LoveSick,
                Which talks about love. Yeah I guess you can say we are kinda of a little emotional peeps but chill the
                songs are great. We finally got it released on Valentines day so now the goal is to have those songs
                heard and honestly I just want to know which one is better. But at the same time I would like to start
                moving up because those songs were made with hard work and dedication. Now this year we are also trying
                to release a nice summer song name not allowed to be said just yet. But this summer to perfect the
                summer vibe to bring people together and have fun a little. The goal is to be said to try and have a
                nice following...
