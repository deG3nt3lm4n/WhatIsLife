      <p>
        <strong>Aubrei Prince</strong> has been a good friend of mine for
        about 6-7 years now.He is a close friend of mine in which helps me out
        when I need some helping out. He is a
        <strong>Song Write/Artist</strong> as well as a very respected
        <strong>Desginer</strong>. As well as the creater of
        <strong>Navy's Own Records</strong>. He is good with all the adobe
        products from video editing to graphics design to photo design. He is
        a skilled indivudual and I am grateful to have him as a friend. He is
        a great friend as well as a great brother, he has a good heart and
        always does whats is the best simple chill solution. Not that it will
        benifit him but that wouldn't harm anyone in the long run. He is a
        hard worker but also can be a little bit of a procratiner but once
        working on a project, the quality will surprise you.

    <div id="goal">
      <h2 class="l-heading">Current Goal</h2>
      <p>
        So for the moment, we are both working on trying to get his music out
        there. Aubrei Prince finally realeased his album called
        <a href="https://linktr.ee/aubreiprince" target="_blank">BitterSweet</a>. Now this album contains two singles
        call
        <strong>ColdHeart</strong> and <strong>LoveSick</strong>, Which talks
        about love. Yeah I guess you can say we are kinda of a little
        emotional peeps but chill the songs are great. We finally got it
        released on Valentines day so now the goal is to have those songs
        heard and honestly I just want to know which one is better. But at the
        same time I would like to start moving up because those songs were
        made with hard work and dedication. Now this year we are also trying
        to release a nice summer song name not allowed to be said just yet.
        But this summer to perfect the summer vibe to bring people together
        and have fun a little. The goal is to be said to try and have a nice
        following...
